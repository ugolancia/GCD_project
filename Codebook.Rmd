This dataset was generated by the run_analysis script, from the original UCI HAR Dataset (dowloaded and included in the directory).
The original dataset consists of data generated by experiments  carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated into body acceleration and gravity.
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domains.
