This dataset was generated by the run_analysis script, from the original UCI HAR Dataset (dowloaded and included in the directory).
The original dataset consists of data generated by experiments  carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated into body acceleration and gravity.
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domains.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
From the original datasets a secondary dataset was obtained (see README for details).

Following are the specifications for each single variables:

"subject": nominal, the subject from which data were obtained, from 1 to 30

"label": nominal, each of the six activities each subjects was engaged in when the recordings were made (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
